    "## Motivation\n",
    "In this modern era, many people are facing mental health challenges, and most feel uncomfortable sharing their struggles or seeking guidance to address their issues. In fact, some people are unaware of their mental health condition; they believe they are fine but might actually be experiencing mental illness. This AI Agent aims to assess their mental condition and, based on the evaluation, provide motivational content or stress-relief exercises to help improve their well-beingâ€”all without the need to disclose their situation to anyone."
